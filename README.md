#### Intro
Trestle takes a lot of the grunt work out of building sites using the Genesis Framework, providing quick and easy-to-implement solutions to common problems and repetitive tasks. We’ve taken Genesis’ rock-solid foundation, integrated mobile-first CSS, responsive navigation, a full-featured settings panel, and much more. Download. Install. Enjoy.

#### Features
Here are some of Trestle's many features, check out the [Trestle Demo](http://demo.mightyminnow.com/theme/trestle/) for a full list.
* Responsive navigation menu
* Mobile first CSS
* Custom control over post info and meta
* Multiple page layouts
* Auto-generating primary navigation
* Ability to auto-install your favorite plugins
* Helpful theme jQuery
* Compatibility with Genesis Extender plugin
* Optional link icons
* Built-in shortcodes (columns, buttons, Font Awesome, etc)
* Front-end styles appear in editor as well
* And more!

#### Settings & Usage
* The Trestle control panel is located at **Genesis &rarr; Theme Settings**, in the **Trestle** metabox.
